<h1>Geometric Algorithms</h1>

<h2>Purpose of this project</h2>

-Learn geometric algorithms

-Improve C++ and project patterns skills

<h2>Demands</h2>

-visual studio 2019 (project include windows libraries)

-google test (every algorithm has test cases)

-compiler which supports C++2017 features

<h2>Build</h2>

For now there is need to add google test manually to the lib as directory is empty

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -S .. -B $(pwd)
```

<h2>Implemented algorithms </h2>

-finding path in labirynth

-minimum square bounding box

-searching for verticies

-voronoi diagram

-Delano triangulation

<h2>To implement </h2>

-GUI

-better input

-algorithm parallelism

-working on png files as inputs

-algorithms: other ways of finding paths, checking if figure is contiunues, blending figures, ncellular automata


<h4>Currently adding gui</h4>
